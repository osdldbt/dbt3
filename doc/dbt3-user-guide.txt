Introduction
------------

This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the Open Source
Development Lab's Database Test 3 (DBT-3) kit.  This kit provides what is
needed to execute a workload similar to the TPC-H workload using PostgreSQL,
MySQL, and MariaDB.

Query Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TPC-H DBGEN tool kit includes the official query syntax for TPC-H queries.
The tester can substitute DBT-3 queries with TPC-H queries and alter the
syntax to fit other databases.  A set of query syntax for SAP DB, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, and MariaDB are included in the kit in the directory dbt3/queries.
Some of the queries are modified for database specific syntax.

Setup
-----

This section covers the steps of getting and installing the DBT-3 test kit
source code.

Getting and Installing the Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the DBMS software, the following is also required:

* bc http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/bc.html
* R http://www.r-project.org/
* sar, pidstat http://pagesperso-orange.fr/sebastien.godard/ (While the
  scripts assume this particular version of +sar+ and +pidstat+, it is
  possible to run on non-Linux based operating systems with some modifications
  to the kit.)

DBT-3 Test Kit Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latest stable version of the kit can be found on SourceForge
via:

 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=52479

The latest development version of the kit can be checked out using git:

 git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/osdldbt/dbt3

Building the kit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configure script needs to be run with the specific DBMS to build qgen and
dbgen.  These programs were developed to be build for specific databases at
compile time.  Otherwise the rest of the scripts installed by the kit do not
need to be reinstalled or recreated if a different DBMS is used.

For MySQL and MariaDB:

 ./configure --with-mysql

For PostgreSQL:

 ./configure --with-postgresql

Once the configure script has been run, the kit is built and installed by:

 make
 make install

Sizing the System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scale factor can actually be any decimal number (like 1.1 or 50) so that
if the tester wishes, the tester can create a database whose size is not one
of the officially permitted scale factors.  This might be desirable for
development purposes.  Any results should be advertised with the scale factor
used, since the performance varies based on the amount of data required for
processing the queries.  The database size is defined with reference to scale
factor.  For example, for scale factor 1, the raw data files' total size is
roughly 1 GB.

Note:  This kit does not support scale factors less than 1.  Although you can
build a database using scale factors less than 1, the query generator (qgen)
will not generate the proper variable values that correspond to scale factors
less than 1.

The tester needs to allocate space for the flat files generated by dbgen used
to load the database.  Once the database is loaded and backed up, there is no
need to retain these flat files.

Using the Test Kit
------------------

Setting DBT-3 Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dbgen, qgen and DBT-3 scripts require specific environment variables
to be set in order to function properly.  The following environment variables
are required to be set and there are examples provides in the examples
directory:

* *DSS_PATH=/tmp/dss_path* - Absolute path in which to build flat files.
* *DSS_QUERY=/tmp/dbt3/queries/pgsql* - Absolute path in which to
  find query templates, this example is for the PostgreSQL templates.
* *DSS_CONFIG=/tmp/dbt3/src/dbgen* - directory in which to find
  DBGEN configuration files.

Testers can choose to run all the tests in DBT-3 as well as part of the tests.
The following section describes how to run all the tests.

Tester may also create several databases so that several scale factors can be
tested or various implementation strategies compared.  They will only need to
change environment variables to point to the correct database prior to
executing the test kit scripts.

Each DBMS may have additional environment variables that need to be set.  The
following sections details the required variables.

MySQL/MariaDB Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* *DBNAME=dbt3* - This is the database name to use.
* *MYDATA=/tmp/mydata* - This defines where to initialize the MySQL data
  directory

PostgreSQL Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* *PGDATABASE=dbt3* - This is the database name to use.
* *PGDATA=/tmp/pgdata* - This defines where the PostgreSQL instance will be
  created.
* *DEFAULT_LOAD_PARAMETERS=``-c shared_buffers=1GB''* - This defines the
  database parameters to be set for the load test.  The syntax is that same as
  that used to set parameters from the command line as if using +pg_ctl+.
  (e.g. "-c shared_buffers=1GB")
* *DEFAULT_POWER_PARAMETERS=``''* - This defines the database parameters to set
  for the power test.
* *DEFAULT_THROUGHPUT_PARAMETERS=``''* - This defines the database parameters
  to be set for the throughput test.

Postgres-XL Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the PostgreSQL environment variables, Postgres-XL requires the
following:

* *GTMHOST="pgxl"* - Hostname for the GTM master and Coordinator node.
* *HOSTNAMES="pgxl1 pgxl2"* - A space-delimited list of hostnames for the
  Datanodes.export GTMDATA="$PGDATA/gtm"
* *COORDINATORDATA="$PGDATA/coordinator"* - Data directory for the Coordinator.
* *GTMPROXYDATA="$PGDATA/gtm_proxy."* - Data directory prefix for the GTM
  proxy.  The node number will be automatically appended to the end.
* *DATANODEDATA="$PGDATA/datanode."* - Data directory prefix for the Datanode.
   The node number will be automatically appended to the end.
* *DNPN=2* - Number of datanodes to create per system node.
* *DNBP=15432* - Starting listener port number for datanodes.
* *DNBPP=25432* - Starting listener port number for datanode pooler.


Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^

Only one command needs to be issued to run a complete test:

 dbt3-run-workload -a pgsql -f 1 -o /tmp/results

This will run the generate the data files for a 1GB scale factor database load,
power and throughput test, with 1 stream, against PostgreSQL and record the
results of the test in _/tmp/results_.

The +dbt3-run-workload+ script can be used to run any combination of a load
test, power test, and throughput test.  A load tests must be run in order to
create the database before a power or throughput tests can be run
individually.

Addition PostgreSQL execution notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is an additional _-e_ flag that can be used for testing PostgreSQL with
the +dbt3-run-workload_ script that will execute the queries in the power and
throughput tests using *EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)* thus returning actual
execution plans instead of the query results.

If the _-e_ flag is used, an additional plan disaster report will be
generating showing which queries grossly misestimated the number of rows
returned at each node of the plan.

Addition Postgres-XL execution notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See additional notes for the base PostgreSQL version for items that also apply
to Postgres-XL.

A Postgres-XL cluster can be built in many different ways.  The scripts in this
kit builds them only in one specific configuration:

                    +-------------+
                    | GTM Master  |
                    | Coordinator |
                    +-------------+
                   /       |       \
                  /        |        \
                 /         |         \
                /          |          \
 +-------------+    +-------------+    ...
 |  GTM Proxy  |    |  GTM Proxy  |
 |  Datanode   |----|  Datanode   |----
 +-------------+    +-------------+

Test Results
------------

The results directory, as specified when running the
+dbt3-run-workload-scripts+ by the _-o_ option, will contain the calculated
metrics of the test as well as charts of the system and database statistics
summarized in the +index.html+ file in the results directory.

The query results chart display the execute time of each query for the power
test, and the arithmetic mean of each of the streams in the throughput test.

The links to the load test, power test, and throughput test summaries will have
links to processor and disk utilization charts as well as operating system and
database parameters used in each test.  The power test and throughput test will
also have links to the query plans and query results.

Tips & Tricks
-------------

Linux perf tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scripts assume that the kernel address maps are not restricted if the Linux
perf tool is used.  To make sure they are unrestricted, set the Linux kernel
parameter to zero by:

 echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
 echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

or editing +/etc/sysctl.conf+ with:

 kernel.kptr_restrict = 0
 kernel.perf_event_paranoid = -1

then as *root* run:

 sysctl -p

MySQL/MariaDB Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using +mysqladmin+ to start the database, options will be loaded from one
of these locations, if they exist: +/etc/my.cnf+, +/etc/mysql/my.cnf+, or
+~/.my.cnf+.  The environment variable *MYSQL_HOME* can also be used to
specify where a my.cnf file exists.

QGEN
~~~~

The +qgen+ program can be manually run to inspect the SQL statement to that
will be executed by the test.

For example (see +qgen -h+ for option descriptions) to see what the first
query to be executed:

 qgen -c -r 0 -p 0 -s 1 5

Results in the following query for PostgreSQL.

 -- using 0 as a seed to the RNG
 -- @(#)14.sql	2.1.8.1
 -- TPC-H/TPC-R Promotion Effect Query (Q14)
 -- Functional Query Definition

 		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
 			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
 		else 0
 	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
